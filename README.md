# NoCode
 Plugin for IntelliJ IDEs that adds [No Code](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/nocode) support

> Write nothing; deploy nowhere. (c)

Existing features:
- Create a No Code project without any code
- Add a `.nocode` file without any code
- Get warned about code in your `.nocode` file with a quick-fix to (you guessed it) remove any code

Future ideas:
- Settings to not configure anything
- Gutter icons to run nothing and deploy nowhere
- Run configuration to not run and debug your No Code application
- No Code tool window to assist with deploying nothing nowhere
